A sub-grid model accounting for the interaction of spray and sub-grid turbulence was developed and tested. The model predicts the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity used for calculating the slip velocity in Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian Large-eddy simulation spray models. The dispersion velocity is assumed to be decomposed into a deterministic and a stochastic part, and it is updated in every turbulence correlation time for each computational parcel. The model was validated against
two datasets: volume-of-fluid simulations and Engine Combustion Network experiments...
