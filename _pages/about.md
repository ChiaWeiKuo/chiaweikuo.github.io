Welcome, I am Chia-Wei Kuo, a Ph.D. student majored in Mechanical Engineering (with a minor in Math) at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), and [the member of Phi Kappa Phi ](https://phikappaphi.advising.wisc.edu/) over there. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing a new two-phase flow C++ solver for performing high-fidelity spray imulations. 

Before pursuing the Ph.D. degree, I spent 3 years working in Taiwan as a full-time employee in industry and academia, respectively. In industry, I was working on the mechanical design of ventilization fan, while in academia I was concentrating on solar thermal research. 

The research topics I am familar with are:
- _two-phase flow simulations, numerical heat transfer, numerical solver development, adaptive mesh refinement_
- _modeling of Lagrangian droplet breakup/vaporization_
- _modeling of soler diffusion fraction_
- _computer-aided engineering_

The software and/or programming laguages I haved used are:
- _OpenFOAM_
- _ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS CFX_
- _Pointwise, ICEMCFD_ 
- _AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Pro/E_
- _C++, MATLAB, C, FORTRAN_
