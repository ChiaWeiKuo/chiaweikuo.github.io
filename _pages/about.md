Hi, I am Chia-Wei Kuo, a PhD student in mechanical engineering department at University of Wisconsin - Madison. I received my B.S. from aerospace engineering at National Cheng Kung University, and M.S. from mechanical engineering at National Taiwan University. 

I had 3-year full-time working experiences at mechanical product designs and solar thermal research. I am the member of Phi Kappa Phi at University of Wisconsin - Madison, and the member of Phi Tau Phi at National Cheng Kung University. 

I am specialized in [computational fluid dynamics], [numerical heat transfer], [computer-aided engineering], [two-phase flow simulation], [numerocal solver development], [modeling of Lagrangian droplet breakup/vaporization], [adaptive mesh refinement], [soler thermal energy]. 

I have used [ANSYS Fluent], [ANSYS CFX], [OpenFOAM], [TRNSYS], [AutoCAD], [SolidWorks], [Pro/E] and so on.

I used [C++] and [MATLAB] as the two primary programming languages.
