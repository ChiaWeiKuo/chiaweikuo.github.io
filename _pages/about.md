Welcome, I am Chia-Wei Kuo, a Ph.D. student majored in Mechanical Engineering (with minored in Math) at University of Wisconsin - Madison, and is the member of Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing a new two-phase flow C++ solver for performing high-fidelity spray imulations. I am the member of Phi Kappa Phi at University of Wisconsin - Madison

Before pursuing the Ph.D. degree, I spent 3 years working in Taiwan as a full-time employee in industry and academia, respectively. In industry, I was working on the mechanical design of ventilization fan, while in academia I was concentrating on solar thermal research. 

The research topics I am familar with are:
- computational fluid dynamics, numerical heat transfer, two-phase flow simulations, numerocal solver development, adaptive mesh refinement 
- modeling of Lagrangian droplet breakup/vaporization
- soler thermal energy
- computer-aided engineering

The software and/or programming laguages I haved used are:
- OpenFOAM
- ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS CFX
- Pointwise, ICEMCFD 
- AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Pro/E
- C++, MATLAB, C, FORTRAN
