Welcome! I am Chia-Wei Kuo, a Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical Engineering (with a minor in Math) at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), and [the member of Phi Kappa Phi ](https://phikappaphi.advising.wisc.edu/) over there. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing a new two-phase flow C++ solver for performing high-fidelity spray simulations. 

Before pursuing the Ph.D. degree, I spent three years working in Taiwan as a full-time employee in industry and academia. In industry, I  worked on the mechanical design of ventilation fans, while in academia, I focused on solar thermal research.

My research has been published in _International Journal of Multiphase Flow_, _International Journal of Engine Research_, _Renewable Energy_, _Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers_, _Procedia Engineering_, and _Energy Procedia_.
