My research falls into five areas.

# 1. Computational Fluid Dynamics
- _Developing a new two-phase compressible flow C++ solver for atomization simulations_
- _High-fidelity spray simulations under engineering conditions_
- _Performance evaluation of the adaptive mesh refinement solver InterDyMFOAM_


# 2. Modeling of Two-Phase Flows
- _Modeling of secondary droplet breakup_
- _Modeling of Lagrangian droplet vaporization_


# 3. Heat Transfer
- _Heat dissipation analysis of a totally-enclosed fan-cooled motor_
- _Heat transfer analysis of an industrial oven_


# 4. Solar Energy
- _Modeling of soler diffusion fraction_
- _Design of a compound parabolic solar collector_
- _Establishing a typical meteorological year database_


# 5. Mechanical Design
- _Frame design of a totally-enclosed fan-cooled motor_
- _Desgin of a hyperbolic reflective shock tunnel_
