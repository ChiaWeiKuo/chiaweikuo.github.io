My research falls into five areas, as follows.

# 1. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- _Developing a new two-phase flow C++ solver for performing high-fidelity spray simulations_
- _Developing new numerical algorithms for two-phase compressible pressure and energy calculations_
- _Performing high-fidelity atomization simulations using realistic engineering nozzle configuration_
- _Performance evaluation of the adaptive mesh refinement solver interDyMFoam_
- _Downwash flow analysis of unmanned aerial vehicle_
- _Verification of Lagrangian equation of motion under low-Weber number conditions_


# 2. Modeling of Two-Phase Flows
- _Modeling of secondary droplet breakup_
- _Modeling of Lagrangian droplet vaporization_


# 3. Thermal/Heat Transfer Analysis
- _Enhanced the heat transfer performance of a large-scale industrial motor_
- _Optimized the thermal dissipation performance of an industrial oven_


# 4. Computer-aided Design (CAD) 
- _Frame/Fin designs of a totally-enclosed fan-cooled motor_
- _Desgin of a hyperbolic reflective shock tunnel_


# 5. Renewable Energy
- _Modeling of solar diffusion fraction_
- _Design of a compound parabolic solar collector_
- _Established a typical meteorological year database_
