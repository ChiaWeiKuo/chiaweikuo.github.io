The research topics I am familiar with are:
- _two-phase flow simulations, numerical heat transfer, numerical solver development, adaptive mesh refinement_
- _modeling of Lagrangian droplet breakup/vaporization_
- _modeling of soler diffusion fraction_
- _computer-aided engineering_

For the details, please see my [CV](https://phxiranter.github.io/chiaweikuo.github.io/files/CWK_CV.pdf).
