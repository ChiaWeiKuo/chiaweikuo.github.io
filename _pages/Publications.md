Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) provides an attractive means of significantly reducing computational costs while simultaneously maintaining a high degree of fidelity in regions of the domain requiring it. In the present work, an analysis of the performance of AMR supported by simulations is undertaken for liquid injection and spray formation problems. These problems are particularly challenging from a com- putational cost perspective since the associated interfacial area typically grows by orders of magnitude, leading to similar growth in the number of highly refined cells. While this increase in cell numbers directly contributes to a declining performance for AMR, a second less obvious factor is the decaying trend for the cell-based speedup....

A sub-grid model accounting for the interaction of spray and sub-grid turbulence was developed and tested. The model predicts the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity used for calculating the slip velocity in Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian Large-eddy simulation spray models. The dispersion velocity is assumed to be decomposed into a deterministic and a stochastic part, and it is updated in every turbulence correlation time for each computational parcel. The model was validated against two datasets: volume-of-fluid simulations and Engine Combustion Network experiments. The volume-of-fluid data showed that dispersion velocities at the centerline are anisotropic. This qualitative feature is well captured by the current model. For the Engine Combustion Network Spray A cases, it was found that sub-grid scale dispersion has profound impact on the prediction of the spatial distribution of liquid mass. Neglecting the sub-grid scale dispersion model results in underprediction of the width of the lateral projected liquid mass density profiles. Also, the prediction of the projected liquid mass density is sensitive to the two model constants determining the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity magnitude and turbulence time scale. However, the predictions of resolved gas-phase statistics are relatively insensitive to different sub-grid scale dispersion model setups. The primary reason for this was investigated. It was found that the motion of high-momentum liquid blobs in the near-nozzle region leading to air entrainment and subsequent gas jet development is minimally influenced by sub-grid scale dispersion. The importance of sub-grid scale dispersion inversely correlates with drag force magnitude: the larger the drag force, the less critical the sub-grid scale dispersion. Moving further downstream, quasi-equilibrium between the two phases is established, resulting in relatively small slip velocity and drag force.

# (2015) In-situ measurements of solar diffuse fraction in southern Taiwan
Chia-Wei Kuo and Keh-Chin Chang, "In-situ measurements of solar diffuse fraction in southern Taiwan", Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers</i>. Vol. 38(6), pg. 723-730, 2015.

Information on diffuse fraction is vital for solar energy applications using concentrating techniques such as concentrating photovoltaic and concentrating solar power. To provide this information for Taiwan, in situ measurements of solar diffuse fraction have been conducted at the Kuei-Jen campus of the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan since 2011. Calculations of the daily, monthly, and annual average diffuse fractions were made with five various sunshine durations centered at the solar noon in the years of 2011 and 2012. It was found that the mean value of annual diffuse fractions of these two years counting from sunrise to sunset is 0.543, while this value is reduced, to a small extent (<6%), with use of shorter duration in the calculation. A more confident information of diffuse fraction in Taiwan remains to be made through use of a database of a typical meteorological year, which is as yet unavailable.
