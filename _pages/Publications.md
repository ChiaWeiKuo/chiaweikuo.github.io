Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) provides an attractive means of significantly reducing computational costs while simultaneously maintaining a high degree of fidelity in regions of the domain requiring it. In the present work, an analysis of the performance of AMR supported by simulations is undertaken for liquid injection and spray formation problems. These problems are particularly challenging from a computational cost perspective since the associated interfacial area typically grows by orders of magnitude, leading to similar growth in the number of highly refined cells. While this increase in cell numbers directly contributes to a declining performance for AMR, a second less obvious factor is the decaying trend for the cell-based speedup....

# (2019)  Evaluation and validation of large-eddy simulation sub-grid spray dispersion models using high-fidelity volume-of-fluid simulation data and engine combustion network experimental data

A sub-grid model accounting for the interaction of spray and sub-grid turbulence was developed and tested. The model predicts the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity used for calculating the slip velocity in Lagrangianâ€“Eulerian Large-eddy simulation spray models. The dispersion velocity is assumed to be decomposed into a deterministic and a stochastic part, and it is updated in every turbulence correlation time for each computational parcel. The model was validated against two datasets: volume-of-fluid simulations and Engine Combustion Network experiments. The volume-of-fluid data showed that dispersion velocities at the centerline are anisotropic. This qualitative feature is well captured by the current model. For the Engine Combustion Network Spray A cases, it was found that sub-grid scale dispersion has profound impact on the prediction of the spatial distribution of liquid mass. Neglecting the sub-grid scale dispersion model results in underprediction of the width of the lateral projected liquid mass density profiles. Also, the prediction of the projected liquid mass density is sensitive to the two model constants determining the sub-grid scale dispersion velocity magnitude and turbulence time scale. However, the predictions of resolved gas-phase statistics are relatively insensitive to different sub-grid scale dispersion model setups. The primary reason for this was investigated. It was found that the motion of high-momentum liquid blobs in the near-nozzle region leading to air entrainment and subsequent gas jet development is minimally influenced by sub-grid scale dispersion. The importance of sub-grid scale dispersion inversely correlates with drag force magnitude: the larger the drag force, the less critical the sub-grid scale dispersion. Moving further downstream, quasi-equilibrium between the two phases is established, resulting in relatively small slip velocity and drag force.

# (2015) In-situ measurements of solar diffuse fraction in southern Taiwan
Chia-Wei Kuo and Keh-Chin Chang, "In-situ measurements of solar diffuse fraction in southern Taiwan", <i>Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers</i>. Vol. 38(6), pg. 723-730, 2015.

Information on diffuse fraction is vital for solar energy applications using concentrating techniques such as concentrating photovoltaic and concentrating solar power. To provide this information for Taiwan, in situ measurements of solar diffuse fraction have been conducted at the Kuei-Jen campus of the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan since 2011. Calculations of the daily, monthly, and annual average diffuse fractions were made with five various sunshine durations centered at the solar noon in the years of 2011 and 2012. It was found that the mean value of annual diffuse fractions of these two years counting from sunrise to sunset is 0.543, while this value is reduced, to a small extent (<6%), with use of shorter duration in the calculation. A more confident information of diffuse fraction in Taiwan remains to be made through use of a database of a typical meteorological year, which is as yet unavailable.

# (2015) Fin designs of TEFC motor heat dissipation enhancement

Literature on the study of fins for heat transfer enhancement mainly focused on the low speed airflow for small electronic devices. For heat removal from large devices such as TEFC motors, studies were limited. In this work, several fin designs based on the dimensions of the TECO TEFC motor were attempted and studied numerically in use of the commercial software ANSYS. The simulation system consists of flat-plate fins periodically mounted on the frame and a wind shield; Fig.1 shows one period of the system. Cold air of 298K at speed Uin = 20m/s is directed into the flow channels between fins to cool the hot area maintained at 333K of the frame, which has an area of L X P . The remaining part of the frame is insulated. The RNG k-epsilon model was used, in conjunction with the standard wall function, to capture the turbulent effect. A 3D hybrid mesh composed of structured as well as unstructured grids was employed for spatial discretization. No-slip boundary conditions were imposed at all solid walls.

# (2014) Modeling the hourly solar diffuse fraction in Taiwan

Using the data for global and diffuse radiation in Tainan, Taiwan, for the years of 2011 and 2012, respectively, four correlation models with five predictors: the hourly clearness index (kt), solar altitude, apparent solar time, daily clearness index and a measure of persistence of global radiation level, are constructed to relate the hourly diffuse fraction on a horizontal surface (d) to the clearness index. Two models use a single logistic equation for all kt values, Eqs. (6), (7), and the other two models use a set of piece-wise linear equations for four kt intervals, Eqs. (8), (9). The proposed models are compared respectively with the fourteen models available in the literature, in terms of the four statistical indicators: the mean bias error, the root-mean-square error, the t-statistic and the Bayesian Information Criterion, using the out-of-sample dataset for Tainan, Taiwan. It is concluded from the analysis that the proposed piece-wise linear models perform well in predicting the diffuse fraction, while the performances of the proposed logistic models are more case-dependent. Among those fourteen models considered in this study, the models developed by Erbs et al., Chandrasekaran and Kumar, and Boland et al. have competitive performances as the proposed piece-wise linear models do, when applying to the prediction of diffuse fraction in Tainan, Taiwan.

# (2014) The design and optical analysis of compound parabolic collector

For various applications of solar thermal energy, the compound parabolic collector (CPC) is frequently used. To overcome the major limits of a traditional CPC, including a rapid increase in height for a larger aperture width and a low concentration ratio, a modified design was proposed in this paper. This research follows the recent study of Jadhav et al., which used only the region below the common focus of parabolas. Through optical analysis, a design modification was achieved by adjusting the vertical position of the receiver. From the results, setting the height of the receiver to 0.46 times the aperture width was found to permit a greater collection range of incident rays. In addition, a better method for evaluating the performance of the CPC was proposed using an intercept factor to account for the total reflection phenomenon caused by the receiver. By applying the approach to different cases of focal length, it was shown that the concentration ratio was not strongly affected by an increasing focal length owing to the low correlation between the concentration ratio and focal length.

A simple polynomial model of the sky clearness index as predictor was proposed in this paper, for estimating the hourly solar diffuse fractions in Taiwan. The error analysis was performed through two statistical indicators, the mean bias error and the root-mean-square error. The out of database validation was also made to confirm the model generality. Next, regressions between monthly averaged conditions and geographical parameters of places (latitude, longitude, and elevation above sea level) were discussed, using the model's estimates and the updated data sets of typical solar radiation year. Based on the results, diffuse fraction maps for two observation periods were presented in 1-km resolution via an aid of linear interpolation.

# (2013) Modeling of heat transfer in an industrial electric oven
Chia-Wei Kuo, Yu-Cheng Liu, and Wen-Chey Chang, "Modeling of heat transfer in an industrial electric oven", <i> The 20th National Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, Nantou, Taiwan</i>. 2013.

The thermal dissipation performance of an industrial electric oven is studied. It is shown from the experimental measurements that the temperature variations inside the oven can reach 20 K, which is determinantal to the thermal collection efficiency of the oven. We employ ANSYS Fluent to establish a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to cope with the problem. The simulation results show that the poor thermal insulation at oven door slots is the main reason behind this uneven temperature distribution problem. A modified oven design is then proposed using the CFD model. Compared with the original design, a more uniform temperature distribution could be reached using the modified design.
