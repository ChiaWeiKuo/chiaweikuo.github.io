This section includes the two-phase flow simulation animations I made during my PhD studies. 

# 1. Simulating the breakup of a liquid droplet into gas
- This is my self-practice project. 
- Date: 2018-07-11

Below shows the time trace of the secondary breakup of a liquid droplet. This simulation is performed using one of my models develeopd in my PhD research. I did this purely for entertainment, so the rigorous examination of the result is absent!

# 2. Stanging wave motion
- This is part of my PhD work
- Date: 2017-11-11

Below is the simulation of standing wave motion due to surface tension. Blue region is air, and red region is liquid, and the black lines are the mesh.
