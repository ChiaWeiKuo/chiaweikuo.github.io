This section includes the two-phase flow simulation animations I made during my PhD studies. 

# 1. Secondary breakup of a liquid droplet
- Date: 2018-07-11

Below shows the time trace of the secondary breakup of a liquid droplet. This simulation is performed using one of my models develeopd in my PhD research. I did this purely for entertainment, so the rigorous examination of the result is absent!

# 2. Rayleigh breakup
- Date: 2017-11-11

The simulation result of Rayleigh breakup of a liquid column due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability is shown below. Yellow region is liquid, and the black lines are the computational grid.

# 3. Pure advection
- Date: 2017-11-11

Here is the simulation result of pure advection (i.e. the momentum equation is not numerically solved). Yellow region is liquid, and the black lines are the computational grid.
