This page shows the images/animations of the two-phase flow simulations I made during my PhD studies. 


# 1. Atomization of high-speed liquid jet
- Date: 2021-04-14

The atomization of a liquid jet injected from an engineering nozzle is shown below. The light blue is liquid. The ambient environment is high-pressure air.

# 2. Secondary breakup of a liquid droplet
- Date: 2018-07-11

Below shows the time trace of the secondary breakup of a liquid droplet. This simulation is performed using one of my models develeopd in my PhD research. I did this purely for entertainment, so the rigorous examination of the result is absent!

# 3. Rayleigh breakup
- Date: 2017-11-11

The temporal evoluation of Rayleigh breakup of a liquid column due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability is shown below. Yellow region is liquid, and the black lines are the computational grid.

# 4. Pure advection
- Date: 2017-11-11

Below is the time history of a pure advection case (i.e., the momentum equation is not numerically solved); yellow region is liquid, and the black lines are the computational grid.
