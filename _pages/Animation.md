This page includes the images/animations of the two-phase flow simulations I made during my PhD studies. 



# 1. Atomization of high-speed liquid jet
- Date: 2021-04-14

The atomization of a liquid jet injected from an engineering nozzle is shown below. The light blue is liquid. The ambient environment is high-pressure air.

# 2. Secondary breakup of a liquid droplet
- Date: 2018-07-11

Below is the time trace of the secondary breakup of a liquid droplet. This simulation is performed using one of the droplet models developed in my PhD research.

# 3. Rayleigh breakup
- Date: 2017-11-11

The temporal evolution of the Rayleigh breakup of a liquid column due to Rayleigh instability is shown below. The yellow region is liquid, and the black lines are the computational grid.

# 4. Pure advection
- Date: 2017-11-11

The time history of a pure advection case (i.e., the momentum equation is not numerically solved) is displayed below; the yellow region is liquid, and the black lines are the computational grid.
